SolChit Fund 3.0(Digital Committee) is a decentralized rotating savings protocol (ROSCA / Chit Fund) built on the Solana blockchain using Rust and the Anchor framework.

The protocol replaces the traditional trust-based chit fund organizer with deterministic on-chain logic, transparent accounting, and program-controlled vaults.

This project demonstrates full-stack Web3 architecture:
1. On-chain smart contract in Rust
2. SPL token (USDC) vault management
3. Anchor-based program structure
4. TypeScript client integration
5. Next.js frontend with wallet connection
